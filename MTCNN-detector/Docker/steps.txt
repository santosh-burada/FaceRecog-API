don't involve tensorflow packages in the docker-req.txt directly from the default generated 
requrements.txt. Because when you do pip freeze in macos it will add tensorflow-macos to the packages.
It might not be compatiable with the docker base linux image.

run basic docker commands from the current directory like below to build and push the docker image to the docker hub

1) docker build -t crop_face:latest .
2) docker run -d -p 8001:8001 crop_face 
3) docker logs <container_id> # to see the wheather the container is running or not.
4) docker tag 8dd30824c2d7 santoshburada/crop_face:latest
5) docker push santoshburada/crop_face:latest
